@VirginAmerica SFO-PDX schedule is still MIA.
"@VirginAmerica Hi, Virgin! I'm on hold for 40-50 minutes -- are there any earlier flights from LA to NYC tonight; earlier than 11:50pm?"
@VirginAmerica you're the best!! Whenever I (begrudgingly) use any other airline I'm delayed and Late Flight :(
"@VirginAmerica just landed in LAX, an hour after I should of been here. Your no Late Flight bag check is not business travel friendly #nomorevirgin"
@VirginAmerica why must a traveler miss a flight to Late Flight check a bag?  I missed my morning appointments and you lost my business. #sfo2lax
@virginamerica how's a direct flight FLL-&gt;SFO have unexpected layover in Vegas 4 fuel yet peeps next to me bought for Vegas flight. #sneaky
@VirginAmerica your no Late Flight bag check just lost you my business. I missed flight and AM apt. Three other people on flight had same exp.
"@VirginAmerica should I be concerned that I am about to fly on a plane that needs to be delayed due to a ""tech stop""?"
@VirginAmerica Another delayed flight? #likingyoulessandless
@VirginAmerica please provide status for flight 769.  I cant imagine it's on time as the Web indicates  dude to weather here and/or Dallas
"@VirginAmerica got a flight (we were told) for 4:50 today..,checked my email and its for 4;50 TOMORROW. This is unacceptable."
@VirginAmerica flight 404 delayed 2 hours in LA due to mechanical problems. Handle like pros but you could have tossed us a free drink.
@VirginAmerica What is the reason  for the delay of the departure of VX 413 from JFK this afternoon?
"@VirginAmerica spending my birthday night with you, DAL-DCA. Get me home!"
@VirginAmerica delayed to10.30!!
@VirginAmerica Why is it taking 12 years to fly home to Dallas? Get your shit together.
@VirginAmerica my flight (6000) scheduled for 1pm departure still says on time but no plane at gate. Any update on how long of a delay?
@united Delayed due to lack of crew and now delayed again because there's a long line for deicing... Still need to improve service #united
"@united See? We were told repeatedly that the pilot was Late Flight and kept getting Late Flightr.  After we boarded, there was a defibrillator issue."
@United well sitting on the ground 'on time' but waiting for a gate....again #tiredofthis
@united A measly $50 e-certificate is not how you appreciate loyal customers after they wait 3hrs on the tarmac during UA1116. #unacceptable
"@united in addition, my first flight was delayed an hour and I'm arriving at my destination 8 hrs Late Flight."
@united I tried but no one was available in bogota and everyone was rude in Houston. I was stuck for 35 hours because of you guys
@United. What's going on with UA 236?  outbound flight last thurs was delayed 4hrs How long will this delay be? #worst2unitedflightsever
@united #worst2unitedflightsever UA1429 IAD to LAS 2/19 mechanical problems - switched aircraft delayed 3.5 hours!
@united ua1673 still waiting! Supposed to depart 9:08
@united 2nd flight also delayed no pilots! But they boarded is so we can just sit here! #scheduling
@united Yeah sorry but there's always a problem with United. And you have an international reputation for having problems.
"@united I've sent the message, let me know if you got it. I'm not very twitter-literate. Also, is he REALLY going to be stuck for 18hrs?"
@united common!! keep your paper work ready and don't delay our flights(#1585)and meetings @ChooseChicago
"@united yep that's correct, I got an email at 12:30 am that the flight was Cancelled Flightled, doesn't matter now flight into atl is delayed, thx"
@united 1k and had problem getting out of FLL to IAH  sent DM to you about making my connection  please let me know
@United flight delayed-no one remembered to turn the heat on flight 559 leaving ORD-seriously???
@united it was UA flight 1001! Now I'm currently stuck in Portland because I missed my ride because of the 3 hour delay. #GetMartyHome
"@united It's still a valid flight. Just seems strange to delay for Late Flight inbound crew,  7 hours from now, when the plane is already here."
@united no Cancelled Flightn just left us to fend for ourselves when flt came in Late Flight. Getting runaround for 3 hrs. Each employee blaming  previous 1.
@united on 4124 arriving two hours Late Flight into CLT. Now sitting on the tarmac while they move a plane from the gate. Unhappy customer.
@united 4 passengers after a 2 hour delayed flight left with no hotel at the end of the night @ hou airport. Wtf??!!
"Hey @united why does the flight from IAH to POS leave so Late Flight, and the one back to IAH so early? I rather get to POS earlier"
"@united good to know you will open the closed doors for ""premier passengers"" after safety briefings on delayed flights. #annoyed."
@united yea get me to phoenix already. Delays all day with you people. It's bullshit.
"@united If it's any consolation, your staff was stellar. Just not the hour+ delays I encountered with every one of my 4 flights."
@united can you ask your guys with flight 1146 to BWI to wait for us to get off a delayed flight from San Diego? Pretty please?
@united Yo yo yo stuck on the tarmac for over 2 hours at @fly2ohare ... Going to miss my ride at @flypdx help please! #HelpImStuck #United
@united  Delay DEN-CLE because they have to manually enter baggage tags? Really? Worst cust service day for this 1ker. #friendlyskies??
"@united Late Flight to Denver, Late Flight to Newark...let's not even get into the disaster that was checking bags. Unacceptable."
@united After our unscheduled refueling stop and missing 2 connecting flights we r home n looking 4ward to our bed and a big PB&amp;J sandwich.
@united UA276 sitting at EWR nearly an hour after sked.  Pilot says computers down but no clue when we will leave.  Can you help?
"@united 5 gate changes, two delays.  Even the crew thinks the airline sucks"
@united Today was not your finest. All could have been prevented by one gate agent advising 200 passengers.
@VirginAmerica everything was fine until you lost my bag
"@VirginAmerica We're on flight 910 Vegas to Boston today, checked in online but our bag count didn't register. Can I fix that somehow?"
@VirginAmerica already contacted Central Baggage &amp; sent DM. @RenttheRunway is charging me for the dress that was in the lost suitcase #help
"@VirginAmerica lost my luggage 4 days ago on flight VX 112 from LAX to IAD &amp; I'm calling every day, no response.Please give me back my stuff"
"@VirginAmerica my luggage is gone. I've filed my paperwork, promised a call/email. Still no resolution or response from central luggage."
"@united if the car seat is lost @united should just reimburse me for a new one, this is not a pair of shoes, it's a necessity for my child"
@united then why have I not received my call back its been 3 days...it's an infant car seat how am I supposed to go anywhere with my child
@united just flew to #TelAviv paid $100 from a third suitcase which didn't even make it on the plane! Besides for the impolite service...
@United  My bag is still in Colo Springs. I am disabled and have to search an unfamiliar airport and look for my bag. Not a good outcome
@united they helped me at the baggage service desk.  Said bc TSA screening was down in FLL not all bags made it but bag will be in EWR @ 12
"@united I received 1 bag last night, I am still missing the other one."
@united what time? Who can I call. I need my skis. I will go to the airport and get them. No more faith in United.
@united So they didn't drop my bag overnight &amp; now I'm leaving for a week. This is why you were supposed to hold on to the bag....
"@united ok. To top things off, you've lost my luggage. Could you get ANY worse??? #UnitedAirlines"
@united did  bags make it on the flight out of iad? second day without clothes is pretty inconvenient. We're pretty curious #UnitedAirlines
@united did our bags leave Washington yet? That would be convenient seeing as we left there a day ago. #UnitedAirlines #lostluggage
@united about 3 hours ago. I need to work out if my bag can make it to my hotel here in time or if it will need to go elsewhere.
@united Thanks for remembering to load my bag onto my connecting flight. Oh wait you forgot. Iceland should be fun with no clothes....
@united how we looking on getting those bags to Lusaka
@united Could you update me on the suitcase please? The online and phone tracking told me nothing. I was told I'd have it back yesterday!
"@united ..back for the expensive holiday, he worked all year to pay for, that you RUINED! We want compensation &amp; his original case back!"
@united thanks United I understand that. But he would actually like his own bag back! What have you done with it?! He also wants the money..
@united if I pay you $25 and $35 for my luggage to be delivered when I arrive. Why should I have to wait 3 additional days for its delivery?
@united okay ase24766m. Find our luggage.
@united But they are not... lady one phone says its in tel aviv. Tel Aviv united says its in Newark. No one knows and I have nothing...
"@united yes, but still now answers. Many have not had their luggage for 3 days! Unacceptable!!"
@united Lost bag process is broken. Agent promised they'd call &amp; hold my bag when found. Now they're waking me at 3am w/ delivery. #fail
@united Yes. Doesn't make that mistake any less absurd. Doesn't change the fact that I'm very inconveniently missing my luggage tonight.
@united we needed them here asap. Will they make it on today's flight?
"@united tag numbers 0016 964012, 0016 964077, 0016 964078 - let's find these bags."
@united thanks for effing up our holidays - we're missing a full day of skiing due to your baggage team's incompetence at @FlyYOW
@united Connection at ORD was on the exact same plane again. Checked carry-on was apparently taken off &amp; left in Chicago. Pretty ridiculous.
@united Not encouraged that I'll have my CPAP tonight.
@united Yes. Did file a claim as soon as the carousel stopped without my bag on it. Got an email that its found but not sched for delivery
"@united yes in Lusaka, Zambia. My guess is the bags never made the plane at IAD."
@united yes I filed a claim &amp; hope to receive by luggage by 2am. Ridiculous as I had to purchase items to go to sleep &amp; no reimbursement.
@united can you tell me how to file a claim for clothing that had to be purchased?
@united GRK13575M is the file reference
@united wonderful bag claim people - finally have my bag. But why did I catch earlier flight? Original flight just landed. #wastedtime
"@united 3 days Late Flightr and my bag has not left IAD, United is not helping at all. Everyone tells me a different story"
@United how do you lose a gate checked bag DEN to ORD? Direct flight. Ugh.
"@united caught earlier flight to ORD. Gate checked bag, and you've lost it at O'Hare. original flight lands in 20minutes. #frustrating!"
@united Can you please follow for a Dm on a missing bag?
@united what's a good number to call to speak with someone about how you can fix what you did to 50 people and their luggage on Saturday?
@united where's my damn bag??
@united well someone should tell that to the employees at the Denver baggage claim. Still no bag!!!!
"@united the proper response: sorry for your wait, what flight # were you on so we can look into the issue. That's how @Delta would handle."
"@united flight arrives 30 minutes early, but then have we to wait for an hour for our bags."
@united That's not the issue. The fact that no one even called (despite promises) to confirm the bag's location is.
@united or @flysaa has lost my baggage��_ heard different things from different employees of @united. @flysaa has said nothing.
@VirginAmerica you guys messed up my seating.. I reserved seating with my friends and you guys gave my seat away ... _��� I want free internet
@VirginAmerica status match program.  I applied and it's been three weeks.  Called and emailed with no response.
"@VirginAmerica help, left expensive headphones on flight 89 IAD to LAX today. Seat 2A. No one answering L&amp;F number at LAX!"
"@VirginAmerica awaiting my return phone call, just would prefer to use your online self-service option :("
@VirginAmerica Your chat support is not working on your site: http://t.co/vhp2GtDWPk
@VirginAmerica I called a 3-4 weeks ago about adding 3 flights from 2014 to my Elevate...they still haven't shown up...help!
@VirginAmerica heyyyy guyyyys.. been trying to get through for an hour. can someone call me please? :/
@VirginAmerica what is going on with customer service? Is there anyway to speak to a human asap? Thank you.
@VirginAmerica why can't you supp the biz traveler like @SouthwestAir  and have customer service like @JetBlue #neverflyvirginforbusiness
"@VirginAmerica Is it me, or is your website down?  BTW, your new website isn't a great user experience.  Time for another redesign."
@VirginAmerica I can't check in or add a bag. Your website isn't working. I've tried both desktop and mobile http://t.co/AvyqdMpi1Y
@VirginAmerica is anyone doing anything there today?  Website is useless and no one is answering the phone.
@VirginAmerica called your service line and was hung up on. This is awesome. #sarcasm
@VirginAmerica Use another browser! 2015 &amp; a brand with a reputation built on tech response doesn't have a cross-browser compatible website?
@VirginAmerica I like the customer service but a 40 min delay just for connecting passengers seems too long. VA370
@VirginAmerica i need to change my flight thats scheduled in 9 hours and 120 min wait time on phone. Im calling intern. Help!!
@VirginAmerica you are failing your customers because your check in process does not link to TSA pre-check.
@VirginAmerica I need to register a service dog for a first class ticket from SFO &gt; Dulles. The phone queue is an hour or longer. Pls advise
@VirginAmerica having problems Flight Booking Problems on the web site. keeps giving me an error and to contact by phone.  phone is 30 minute wait.
@VirginAmerica is the website down?
@VirginAmerica - Your site seems a little wonked right now. May want to have a look. Tried on two browsers. No CSS? http://t.co/8qsQMM7KF2
@VirginAmerica I'm disappointed that the agent at the designated silver status check in line @Dulles_Airport closed to assist all pasengers
@VirginAmerica Is it normal to receive no reply from Central Baggage #baggageissues #smh
@VirginAmerica  I applied over 2 weeks ago. Haven't heard back and I'm flying this week #disappointed
@VirginAmerica - too many apologies! You r the worse airlines! Don't even respond to your cudtomers
@VirginAmerica too bad you say it takes 10 to 14 days via YOUR confirmation email. When I inquired after 3 weeks you claim 6 to 8 weeks!
@VirginAmerica Your website is down and I'm trying to check in!
@VirginAmerica can��t access your website from Safari on iPhone 6. Seems to work on Mac and iPad. Need iPhone to add Passbook.
"@VirginAmerica your mobile site is broken, shows 
""{{header.elevateUser.numOfPointsAvailable || '0' | number}} Points"", won't let me checkin"
@VirginAmerica I did it but there was a problem in the link from the email for check-in. thanks
@VirginAmerica hold times at call center are a bit much
"@VirginAmerica Trying to reset my password, email never arrives. Help?"
"@VirginAmerica the CSS on your site is a 404 right now, please fix. Site unusable."
"@VirginAmerica Hi, I'm trying to do check-in but the website is not working. I tried 3 different browsers and the problem continues"
@VirginAmerica there is something wrong with you website in Safari iPhone
@VirginAmerica Boo for a not refunding a seat upgrade fee I did not want to buy in the first place!
@VirginAmerica Is there anything going on with the website? I've been getting a lot of errors past 30 minutes.
@VirginAmerica I'm trying to check into my 10:50AM CT flight tmm on the desktop website and it's not working (some sort of caching bug) SOS
@VirginAmerica Do you guys know your check-in links from emails are broken? http://t.co/2npXB6oBMr
"@VirginAmerica can't check in, your site looks like this every time it loads http://t.co/kAcY2AwDbW"
@virginAmerica Other carriers are less than half price for a round trip fare. I am stunned. http://t.co/UKdjjijroW
@VirginAmerica Applied for Status Match on Feb 1. Got confirmation email same day. Still no news though. You guys have dropped ball Late Flightly _�֫
@VirginAmerica trying to check-in...but looks like your site is down?
@VirginAmerica Sent a couple messages to the email you provided but to no avail. Will try again next year. Cheers.
"@VirginAmerica I spoke with a representative that offered no solution, I am a loyal customer who flies on @VirginAtlantic as well"
@VirginAmerica your Avis rental continue button doesn't work on your website to book car. Tried 4 times on phone.  This sucks!
@VirginAmerica currently in minute 10 of being on hold with cust. service. Do I need to do anything to add a lap child to my reservation?
"@VirginAmerica, I submitted a status match request a while back and still haven��t heard! I��m flying on Monday. Can you look / accelerate?"
@VirginAmerica Can I get some help with a support ticket? It's been 15 days.... Incident: 150202-000419 Thank you!
@VirginAmerica FYI the info@virginamerica.com email address you say to contact in password reset emails doesn't exist. Emails bounce.
@VirginAmerica your airline is awesome but your lax loft needs to step up its game. $40 for dirty tables and floors? http://t.co/hy0VrfhjHt
@VirginAmerica You'd think paying an extra $100 bucks RT for luggage might afford you hiring an extra hand at @sfo #lame
@VirginAmerica  for all my flight stuff wrong and did nothing about it. Had #worst #flight ever
@VirginAmerica husband and I ordered three drinks via my screen and they never came. Awesome!
"@VirginAmerica All of group E was told there was no more room in the bins. when I got on the plane, was room for at least 4 bags in my row!"
"@united yes, we've been with the agents for the last 50 minutes. One of the agents have been very rude, but thankfully Ladan has been nice."
"@united iah to charlotte. Baggage claim rep latrice h. #customerservice non existent, Ignored customer then inappropriately touched customer"
"@united v upset with your disability  ""services"". When I told one of your employees I was carrying medical equipment she was very rude."
@united silly I'm flying delta today. Your united club staff and attendants are surly and unhelpful and always seem bothered by pesky folk
@united Had to explain to a very over eager flight attendant trying to ask about my vision that my @ccicanine was not a guide dog!
@united what's the point of asking for details about a #servicedog when you book if your flight crew doesn't read them? (Continued)
@united ours in July. You have ZERO excuses for this. You have an out-of-date system that causes problems like this.
@united so you're telling me there is no number to call after being left in an airport because of a negligent pilot and staff?
@united are the ones who make it difficult for me.
"@united nope, they told us it was time for them to go home and to sleep at the airport. Even though they assured us we would get a room..."
@united 32 people getting pretty tired about no action on solving the problem plus missing a day of vacation and skiing
"@united In ORD, waited 20 min after crew members left before gate items came. Flight attendant sarcastically said good luck and walked away."
@united why would they make me share a room?
"@united well, considering every agent before claimed they were unable to help with everything else, why waste more time to hear 'call corp'"
"@united Why tell us flight is delayed, then tell us it's on time again with 20 min to spare? Don't say it's delayed unless you're sure!"
"@united Flight attendant never served me my beverage (tea), and not once checked up on me. What gives? #ua6076 #notcool"
@united UA63 from Madrid arrived no agent mass confusion we sent to and fro by 3 UA employees. MaryJo was rude and unhelpful.
@united Male agnt in LAS threatens Canadian cust when cust takes pic of him at gate after agents announce can't help rebook. #friendlyskies?
@united Agent in LAS letting 20 customers know they can't help them rebook delayed flight to DEN #unfriendlyskies http://t.co/QuzVmK2rTR
@united I was denied getting on the plane w/o getting the chance to prove it fits. I'm not a rookie. Read my bio.
@united currently on board so not now. Check in was terrible. Staff rude. Expensive luggage thrown around etc.
@united i need it there before she lands so she can have the EWR baggage claim file to have it sent but the employee has not droppeditoffyet
@united Asked Flight attendant what typical compensation would be &amp; says we might get free TV. #Unacceptable
"@united During the same round trip, my NON-English speaking friend was stranded TWICE for 12+ hours each time! Most staff members were rude."
@united Apparently they are asking 20 people to off board the plane--how can such a big miscalculation be made?!
"@united Thank you. Mention that before I boarded she asked 1other person to measure their bag, and it was another woman. Men not asked."
@united is doing musicians real dirty at LAX. I've never been blocked from getting on a flight with my bass.
@united flight attendant doesn��t understand not understanding English doesn��t mean they are deaf. Stop yelling English slowly to them.
@united Flight 211/ORD gate agent tried to prevent me from taking onboard a bag I've used for 15 years! Flight crew was more reasonable!
"@united it's not getting any better. I'd suggest you get a senior manager to this gate , then retrain these gate people"
"@united, b4 boarding this attendant took his shoe &amp;sock off at the desk and showed other agents his foot. So gross. http://t.co/755VpYm4Mv"
@united Arriving at the airport 2 hours before departure time and still missing your flight bc you actually don't have an electronic ticket
"@united is unfriendly screw family, that hates kids and moms. now waiting on  UA871... pray its better FYVRFN ..due to agent error and tickt"
"@united  gate agent at EWR "" if you are disabled or in a wheel chair, it's time to board, please step"". STEP UP??? Lol"
@united forces us to check our baby bag on overbooked flight complains to wife that we need to much for our baby.. united has no baby meals
@united today take flight to san francisco. .. refuse to let us board with baby early... time we board wont let us take baby carryon bag
@united I paid for economy plus and you put me in the last boarding group so I have to gate check my bags too? @VirginAmerica knows better..
@united. Is it reasonable to wait 45 mins for the bag you made me check because the flight staff couldn't police the overhead bins?
"@united yes, but it's not looking. The ticket agent at out terminal dismissed us and we missed a chance at a Miami flight then to DR"
"@united they're not, actually. gate agent was so rude. now standing in a line waiting for reFlight Booking Problems. missed the only flight to STI. awful."
"@united you need to retrain your flight attendants. Saying there is no more room for carry ons when there actually is, is not cool."
@united Another awful experience and Victoria at the check in desk in STL could not have been more rude and condescending.
"@united why do I check in online if I still have to wait in line for an hour to ""check in"" at counter? #fuckinlame  @naia_miaa"
@united I would encourage you to re-interview the sole flight attendant on UAL 6166 from BUF to ORD. Blatantly not stable. Uncomfortable.
@united One of your workers refused to give me her name as a reference for my notes. Her tone &amp; language was very unprofessional.
@united that's why I missed my flight. If the flight had been held for 5 minutes I would have made it. I watched it pull away from the gate
