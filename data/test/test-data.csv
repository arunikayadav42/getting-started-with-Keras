@united please fire the captain of flight 6232 today. He single handedly ruined every passengers day by being a piece of shit. #unitedsucks
@united have an employee at the gate 15min before boarding like u expect ur customers to. Be a competent company like ur rivals
united  you rebooked me in to an 11 hr layover &amp; are robbing me of a night with my family. Too Late Flight for that. Just fly on time for once.
"@united A very disappointing experience - plane mech. delay and next one didn't wait. No sincere apology, just told me to complain online"
"@JetBlue customer service was so bad updating my points, once I use my next points, I won't be flying you. Point system is almost a sham."
@JetBlue she hung up before I can get name. She took no accountability for keeping me on hold +20min. Next rep was not able to track name
@USAirways Baggage Team? Recording tells me my bag still hasn't been found. And delayed baggage link on web conveniently not working. #worst
@USAirways can you DM please in regards to update on lost bag please.
"@AmericanAir I need to go to YYZ tmr morning 8am. I switched to United already, but my bag is still off in AA la-la land."
@AmericanAir I lost my (basket) ballbag on your plane
"@AmericanAir When I left Orlando, I was 2nd in line for standby. I land and I'm 4th. 'Priority members get first available seats'. Awesome."
@AmericanAir You didn't respond to my DM. You tweeted the same canned tweet you're telling everyone else.
@AmericanAir Flight 953 NYC-Buenos Aires has been delay since yesterday at 10PM. Is going to take off at 3.30PM now? Give us answers!
@AmericanAir right on cue with the delays
@AmericanAir a worker just checked for ice on our plane using his cell phone flashlight! Really?! Come on!
@AmericanAir pathetic to have your gate agents lie to my face when you are at fault
